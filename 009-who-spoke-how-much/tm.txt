[2020-05-03T10:10:58+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, guess guess
[2020-05-03T10:11:01+0530] <@kushal> good morning all
[2020-05-03T10:20:29+0530] <RJ722> kushal: lymbook?
[2020-05-03T10:20:35+0530] <RJ722> good morning folks!
[2020-05-03T10:21:39+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, LYM :)
[2020-05-03T10:21:41+0530] <@kushal>  yes
[2020-05-03T10:22:48+0530] <RJ722> kushal: I need to learn this as well. thanks!
[2020-05-03T10:27:04+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, I suddenly realized that I use too much of the arrow keys, I should not do that.
[2020-05-03T10:27:14+0530] <@kushal> now I am forcing myself on that part.
[2020-05-03T10:28:36+0530] <RJ722> kushal: I use qutebrowser + spacemacs (evil). It nearly eliminates my need for arrow keys.
[2020-05-03T10:29:55+0530] <RJ722> arrow keys are mostly used for going back and forth when typing commands on terminal. I need to change that.
[2020-05-03T10:34:48+0530] <@kushal> :)
[2020-05-03T10:35:02+0530] <@kushal> I will be slow only for first few hours
[2020-05-03T10:36:45+0530] <@kushal> That reminds me, I have added a few plugins which I think is useful for me, now have to practice their keystrokes too
[2020-05-03T11:14:47+0530] <@kushal> If I keep the twitter tab open for longer, I am getting depressed more
[2020-05-03T11:16:03+0530] <RJ722> kushal: I have been off twitter for nearly two months now. It is so much better.
[2020-05-03T11:16:36+0530] <RJ722> kushal: also, my first PR to lym. https://github.com/kushaldas/lym/pull/31 :D
[2020-05-03T11:16:39+0530] <@kushal> My usage came down
[2020-05-03T11:16:57+0530] <RJ722> that's nice!
[2020-05-03T11:17:35+0530] <RJ722> kushal: on a different note, are you existing (somewhat) more substantial changes to LYM?
[2020-05-03T11:17:36+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, thank you and already merged :)
[2020-05-03T11:17:42+0530] <RJ722> s/existing/accepting
[2020-05-03T11:17:45+0530] <RJ722> ':D
[2020-05-03T11:17:59+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, I would love to discuss first
[2020-05-03T11:18:56+0530] <RJ722> kushal: I was reading through the workbook chapter. I've a few thoughts:
[2020-05-03T11:21:30+0530] <RJ722> - Before diving straight in, if I have some more context about what exactly this chapter is aiming at, it would be really good. (because  it is different from all the other chapters [albeit, in a very exciting way])
[2020-05-03T11:22:54+0530] <RJ722> - if problems could be numbered, e.g., "Problem 1. Copy Paste", it would be better to isolate context. I actually thought that copy pasting was a part of the process of setting up a problem. Ended up reading the code instead.
[2020-05-03T11:24:12+0530] <RJ722> - Last, add a second heading after "How to install the workbook?", with a generic template about how to start solving a problem. Something like, "vagrant up <problem_name>".
[2020-05-03T11:25:00+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, I don't want the problems to be numbered.
[2020-05-03T11:25:15+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, I would love to get a PR for the rest 2 things you mentioned.
[2020-05-03T11:25:24+0530] <RJ722> kushal: great, I would send a PR.
[2020-05-03T11:26:49+0530] <RJ722> kushal: also, I don't mean to be pushy, just curious: any specific reason for not numbering the problems?
[2020-05-03T11:28:03+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, so that we can reorder anytime :D
[2020-05-03T11:28:25+0530] <RJ722> kushal: ahaha, yes. makes total sense.
[2020-05-03T11:28:47+0530] <@kushal> Also, "I am stuck at problem 7" vs "I am stuck at the problem of deleting an user"
[2020-05-03T11:30:48+0530] <@kushal> I have the terminal open in the right hand side buffer (in normal mode there), now trying to get back to the left side buffer.
[2020-05-03T11:31:45+0530] <@kushal> Because I am idiot that is why i could not move
[2020-05-03T11:46:51+0530] <@kushal> I have total 20 plugins mentioned in my init.vim
[2020-05-03T11:50:52+0530] • saptaks: goes back to my browser based life
[2020-05-03T12:02:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> hello people
[2020-05-03T12:02:39+0530] <RJ722> jasonbraganza: hello, hello!
[2020-05-03T12:02:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> kushal, https://github.com/kushaldas/rst/pull/2 since you are accepting pull requests :P
[2020-05-03T12:02:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> hello RJ722 :)
[2020-05-03T12:04:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> kushal, can batul be brought in here? or is it too much trouble?
[2020-05-03T12:10:31+0530] <@saptaks> My today's find: https://scottvinkle.me/blogs/blog
[2020-05-03T12:17:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> saptaks, nice find!
[2020-05-03T12:21:44+0530] <@kushal> jasonbraganza, batul will be here before the session
[2020-05-03T12:21:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> thank you! :)
[2020-05-03T12:22:59+0530] <@kushal> jasonbraganza, rst module is so old, you can guess that by looking at how it says to install pip.
[2020-05-03T12:23:02+0530] <@kushal> brb
[2020-05-03T12:23:18+0530] • jasonbraganza: has to rush to mum’s. catch ya’ll later
[2020-05-03T12:27:33+0530] <@kushal> saptaks, pepa pig is on that site toooooooooo
[2020-05-03T12:27:42+0530] <@saptaks> kushal, yes
[2020-05-03T12:28:09+0530] <@saptaks> whenever I see pepa pig, py comes to mind
[2020-05-03T12:28:10+0530] <@saptaks> LOL
[2020-05-03T12:28:14+0530] <@kushal> hehe
[2020-05-03T12:28:38+0530] <@saptaks> I have to read through all of those blogs
[2020-05-03T12:28:46+0530] <@saptaks> then apply those changes in my blog and website
[2020-05-03T12:28:52+0530] <@saptaks> and then write my version of blogs
[2020-05-03T12:30:06+0530] <@saptaks> most things mentioned about accessibility are very react-y, eslint-y. Which is good, but if not using javascript package managers, seems a little tricky
[2020-05-03T12:31:07+0530] <RJ722> saptaks: https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/blog is another who talks about accessibility a lot.
[2020-05-03T12:31:14+0530] <@kushal> Because Sunday morning, I played https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvfvn27Akxk in the speaker for Anwesha :)
[2020-05-03T12:31:40+0530] <@kushal> saptaks, accessibility is difficult in every level, think about command line.
[2020-05-03T12:31:40+0530] <RJ722> saptaks: to your liking, she recently wrote a post on creating a CSS slider which was accessible.
[2020-05-03T12:31:44+0530] <@saptaks> RJ722, yeah I know. We have interacted on twitter before
[2020-05-03T12:31:56+0530] <RJ722> saptaks: ah, how nice.
[2020-05-03T12:32:14+0530] <@saptaks> kushal, yes. I am prioritizing web accessibility
[2020-05-03T12:32:28+0530] <@saptaks> I am not only thinking about coders
[2020-05-03T12:32:42+0530] <RJ722> kushal: I raised https://github.com/kushaldas/lym/pull/32. :D
[2020-05-03T12:32:44+0530] <@kushal> saptaks, understood, I am just saying "it is difficult"
[2020-05-03T12:33:00+0530] <@kushal> RJ722, I will check it later, need a fresh brain
[2020-05-03T12:33:09+0530] <RJ722> kushal: yes, please. thanks!
[2020-05-03T12:33:12+0530] <@saptaks> kushal, yes. Writing anything for everyone is difficult. :)
[2020-05-03T12:33:15+0530] <@kushal> my cheese stock is going down and I am scared for that too
[2020-05-03T12:33:25+0530] <@kushal> saptaks, yes, and you chose this :)
[2020-05-03T12:33:42+0530] <@saptaks> Yes. I like to jump into impossible things. :)
[2020-05-03T12:33:45+0530] <@kushal> over an engineering manager at Infy :p
[2020-05-03T12:34:15+0530] <@saptaks> RJ722, one of my favorite blog posts in a11ywithlindsey is this: https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/blog/accessibility-conferences
[2020-05-03T12:34:30+0530] <@saptaks> kushal, this one is actually important and useful for you too ^^
[2020-05-03T12:34:41+0530] <@saptaks> anwesha, for you too ^^
[2020-05-03T12:34:52+0530] <RJ722> saptaks: ah, I think this was how I got introduced to them.
[2020-05-03T12:35:03+0530] <RJ722> and it was probably you who shared the link ':D
[2020-05-03T12:35:06+0530] <@saptaks> yes
[2020-05-03T12:35:08+0530] <@saptaks> lol
[2020-05-03T12:35:12+0530] <RJ722> xD
[2020-05-03T12:35:25+0530] <@saptaks> talking about blogs, here is my new post: https://saptaks.blog/posts/handling-nested-serializer-validations-in-drf.html
[2020-05-03T12:40:02+0530] <RJ722> saptaks: I don't understand most of it, but your website is very neat.
[2020-05-03T12:40:49+0530] <@saptaks> RJ722, well not understanding most of it is a sad part.
[2020-05-03T12:40:58+0530] <@saptaks> But in my defense it's a very specific issue blog
[2020-05-03T12:41:12+0530] <@saptaks> that only few using DRF for a very specific problem might face
[2020-05-03T12:44:08+0530] <RJ722> saptaks: I don't know what a DRF is ':D
[2020-05-03T12:44:14+0530] • RJ722: duckduck's DRF
[2020-05-03T12:44:19+0530] <@saptaks> Django Rest Framework

[2020-05-03T15:05:32+0530] <ssurbhi> Surbhi Sharma
[2020-05-03T15:05:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> that basically was a kind of hurdle i put in place
[2020-05-03T15:05:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> to only get interested folk
[2020-05-03T15:06:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> not that i am averse to it
[2020-05-03T15:06:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> once we get to qa, i have no issues for as long as it takes today evening
[2020-05-03T15:06:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> why do i get to talk to you about time management?
[2020-05-03T15:07:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> because i am seen as old and wise here XD
[2020-05-03T15:07:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> but nevertheless i am still happy for the chance to do this
[2020-05-03T15:07:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> because i *do* know somethings
[2020-05-03T15:07:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> mostly learnt from the school of hard knocks
[2020-05-03T15:07:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> i am a practitioner
[2020-05-03T15:07:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> i still struggle
[2020-05-03T15:08:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> but i would venture to say, i am in a better place timewise, then most of you.
[2020-05-03T15:08:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> so i want to pull you up to my level
[2020-05-03T15:08:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> how many of you were at my handle your money session?
[2020-05-03T15:08:52+0530] <BhaveshSGupta> me
[2020-05-03T15:08:55+0530] <priyankasaggu119> me
[2020-05-03T15:08:57+0530] <j605> me
[2020-05-03T15:08:58+0530] <nightwarrior-xxx> me
[2020-05-03T15:09:02+0530] <pradhvan> me
[2020-05-03T15:09:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> any one remember off hand how long ago that was?
[2020-05-03T15:09:18+0530] <RJ722> Me
[2020-05-03T15:09:20+0530] <hellozee> me
[2020-05-03T15:09:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> 6-7 months?
[2020-05-03T15:09:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> anyway
[2020-05-03T15:09:44+0530] <hellozee> around june or july last year
[2020-05-03T15:09:49+0530] <jasonbraganza> my question being, to you who replied
[2020-05-03T15:09:52+0530] <priyankasaggu119> yes some 7-8 months before.
[2020-05-03T15:10:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> has your life changed materially because of what i shared that day
[2020-05-03T15:10:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> have i made a difference to your lives?
[2020-05-03T15:11:02+0530] <j605> yes, I took an active role in how much I was saving and the percentage which was going into repaying loans and expenses
[2020-05-03T15:11:26+0530] <hellozee> I have a server for me, :)
[2020-05-03T15:11:31+0530] <jasonbraganza> so this is my aim with today’s session too
[2020-05-03T15:11:52+0530] <RJ722> Materially: no. Because I only started making money recently. But, I now put in a lot more conscious effort and planning into managing my finances.
[2020-05-03T15:11:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> if even a single one of you, walks out with one idea that changes your life, i will consider it a success
[2020-05-03T15:12:01+0530] <pradhvan> I do actually keep some of my earnings every month to a safety deposit. :)
[2020-05-03T15:12:18+0530] <priyankasaggu119> yes, it did. I saved for multiple things and have a better organised system now.
[2020-05-03T15:12:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> RJ722, that i conseder a raging success
[2020-05-03T15:12:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> :)
[2020-05-03T15:12:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> so 
[2020-05-03T15:12:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> lets move on
[2020-05-03T15:13:04+0530] <jasonbraganza> somebody go get the links to intention and margin off my blog and put them here please
[2020-05-03T15:13:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> because that is what it will all start with :)
[2020-05-03T15:13:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> so here’s my question
[2020-05-03T15:13:51+0530] <RJ722> https://janusworx.com/on-intention.html
[2020-05-03T15:14:00+0530] <bhavin192> https://janusworx.com/on-intention.html
[2020-05-03T15:14:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> if a robber runs up to you, brandishing a knife, or a gun and says, give it all up? what do you value? your money or your life?
[2020-05-03T15:14:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> what would your answer be?
[2020-05-03T15:14:46+0530] <bhavin192> https://janusworx.com/on-margin/
[2020-05-03T15:15:04+0530] <sourabhdeshmukh> of course life.
[2020-05-03T15:15:06+0530] <j605> life!
[2020-05-03T15:15:14+0530] <priyankasaggu119> Life!
[2020-05-03T15:15:20+0530] <@kushal> jasonbraganza, it depends in my cas.
[2020-05-03T15:15:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> hahahahaha
[2020-05-03T15:15:37+0530] <@kushal> case
[2020-05-03T15:15:47+0530] <brute4s99> Life
[2020-05-03T15:15:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> kushal, in your case it will still be life, unless someone asks you your ideals or your life :)
[2020-05-03T15:16:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> but yes
[2020-05-03T15:16:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> life is what we choose
[2020-05-03T15:16:14+0530] <bhavin192> Money vs life: life!
[2020-05-03T15:16:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> and this is a curious case of domain blindness
[2020-05-03T15:16:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> our jobs 
[2020-05-03T15:16:31+0530] <jasonbraganza> and other things 
[2020-05-03T15:16:42+0530] <jasonbraganza> keep asking us to give more and more of our live
[2020-05-03T15:16:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> and we willingly hand it over without a thought
[2020-05-03T15:17:03+0530] <anwesha> It is LIFE always (I have experienced it)
[2020-05-03T15:17:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> no one thinks of life as the little day to day moments
[2020-05-03T15:17:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> here’s another thought to ponder 
[2020-05-03T15:17:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> most of you are at just the right age for this example
[2020-05-03T15:17:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> you start at 20
[2020-05-03T15:17:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> and die at 70
[2020-05-03T15:18:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> that is your adult life
[2020-05-03T15:18:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> so all you get are 75000 mornings
[2020-05-03T15:18:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> that is it
[2020-05-03T15:18:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> i urge you to put some thought into what you choose to do with each morning, with each day
[2020-05-03T15:18:57+0530] <insaanimanav> wow that is a short time when you look at that this way '
[2020-05-03T15:19:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> life on autopilot is not fun
[2020-05-03T15:19:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> you all already know that
[2020-05-03T15:19:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> or you would not be here
[2020-05-03T15:19:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> so i want to spend a little time on these basics
[2020-05-03T15:19:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you want to learn to manage time
[2020-05-03T15:19:48+0530] <@kushal> jasonbraganza, with 75000 mornings, one has to live 205 years
[2020-05-03T15:20:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> christ
[2020-05-03T15:20:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> sorry
[2020-05-03T15:20:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> and even that insaanimanav thougt was less XD
[2020-05-03T15:20:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> 25000 mornings :)
[2020-05-03T15:20:49+0530] <brute4s99> 18250, to be exact 😅
[2020-05-03T15:20:56+0530] <sourabhdeshmukh> s/75000/18250
[2020-05-03T15:21:03+0530] <bhavin192> brute4s99, as an adult :)
[2020-05-03T15:21:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> seeing your life expectancy down by a thid is not that  much fun is it?
[2020-05-03T15:21:24+0530] <insaanimanav> jasonbraganza no its not
[2020-05-03T15:21:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> and that wos a typo
[2020-05-03T15:21:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> imagine you, just living your life
[2020-05-03T15:21:45+0530] <jasonbraganza> day
[2020-05-03T15:21:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> to 
[2020-05-03T15:21:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> day
[2020-05-03T15:21:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> and suddenly four months have passed
[2020-05-03T15:22:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> what will you do with the rest of your year? :)
[2020-05-03T15:22:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> so here’s a thought experiment
[2020-05-03T15:22:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> you say you want to manage time
[2020-05-03T15:23:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> what will you *do* with the time you get?
[2020-05-03T15:23:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> write it here
[2020-05-03T15:23:26+0530] <insaanimanav> learn new stuff , tinker more
[2020-05-03T15:23:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> or put it in the pad if you want to stay anonymous
[2020-05-03T15:24:14+0530] <j605> read more, get more serious about dutch, bake when I finally get an oven
[2020-05-03T15:24:29+0530] <brute4s99> explore more experiences
[2020-05-03T15:24:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> some is attempting to write, tough to think off
[2020-05-03T15:24:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> all the stuff i am going to suggest 
[2020-05-03T15:24:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> will require thinking and some unpleasant work
[2020-05-03T15:25:04+0530] <jasonbraganza> and you need to *think*
[2020-05-03T15:25:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> to be intentional about what it is that you want from your life
[2020-05-03T15:25:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is your first assignment in the eve when you start
[2020-05-03T15:25:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> read my articles on margin and intention which RJ722 and bhavin192 have graciously share
[2020-05-03T15:26:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> and think about what it is that you want
[2020-05-03T15:26:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> and then write that down and keep it somewhere prominent
[2020-05-03T15:26:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> so that you will keep looking at it
[2020-05-03T15:26:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> and the journey won’t seem that bad
[2020-05-03T15:27:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> some one wrote i don’t know.
[2020-05-03T15:27:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> that is ok, but think about it
[2020-05-03T15:27:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> i’m sure you have somewhere to be, some place to go, something you want out of life.
[2020-05-03T15:28:04+0530] <jasonbraganza> WRITE THAT SHIT DOWN
[2020-05-03T15:28:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> so the only thing i will ask of you is that each of you learn to meditate.
[2020-05-03T15:29:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> give it 5-10 minutes a day
[2020-05-03T15:29:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> that is all
[2020-05-03T15:29:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> Human freedom involves our capacity to pause between the stimulus and response and, in that pause, to choose the one response toward which we wish to throw our weight. The capacity to create ourselves, based upon this freedom, is inseparable from consciousness or self-awareness. — Rollo May
[2020-05-03T15:29:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> and this is why i want you to do so ^
[2020-05-03T15:29:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> to exercise that muscle
[2020-05-03T15:30:20+0530] <zleap> peanutduck, does adding 0.0.0.0 www.facebook.com to /etc/hosts block or allow facebok
[2020-05-03T15:30:23+0530] <zleap> ?
[2020-05-03T15:30:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> so that when life rushes at you tomorrow, your mind is skilled enough to go hold on, hold on, let's think this through
[2020-05-03T15:30:37+0530] <@kushal> zleap, there is a session going on, please ask in dm.
[2020-05-03T15:30:39+0530] <RJ722> zleap: a session is going on. We can continue this later.
[2020-05-03T15:30:51+0530] <zleap> sorry
[2020-05-03T15:31:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> beacuse if you cannot stop and think during the critical moments in your life, you are done for
[2020-05-03T15:31:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> i share the case of a mentee of mine
[2020-05-03T15:31:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> he was offered a jok
[2020-05-03T15:31:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> he did not think
[2020-05-03T15:31:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> blindly said yes
[2020-05-03T15:32:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> and is now (thankfully temporarily) a really low paid intern
[2020-05-03T15:32:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> or interview pressure, we need you to sign this today
[2020-05-03T15:32:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> learn to have the fortitude to push things to the limit
[2020-05-03T15:32:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> and that can only come if you meditate daily
[2020-05-03T15:33:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> sandeepk is not around
[2020-05-03T15:33:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> or i would have gently teased him about his superhero meditation session
[2020-05-03T15:34:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> sorry about that delay
[2020-05-03T15:35:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> i might have to pop out for 5 minutes in a while something unavoidable has come up
[2020-05-03T15:35:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> i apologise
[2020-05-03T15:35:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> so you don’t need an hour long meditation session
[2020-05-03T15:35:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> just 5-20 minutes a day
[2020-05-03T15:35:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> is good
[2020-05-03T15:35:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> that same skill, is also going to help you focus
[2020-05-03T15:36:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> i have two mails who both say they cannot
[2020-05-03T15:36:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is your answer
[2020-05-03T15:36:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> meditate.
[2020-05-03T15:36:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> it will increase your ability to focus
[2020-05-03T15:36:38+0530] <RJ722> !
[2020-05-03T15:36:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T15:36:44+0530] <batul> RJ722 ask your question.
[2020-05-03T15:37:06+0530] <RJ722> jasonbraganza: any particular way in which meditation has to be carried forward?
[2020-05-03T15:37:09+0530] <hellozee> !
[2020-05-03T15:37:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> RJ722, later
[2020-05-03T15:37:15+0530] <insaanimanav> !

[2020-05-03T15:37:18+0530] <batul> insaanimanav you are next, get ready with your question.
[2020-05-03T15:37:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T15:37:25+0530] <batul> insaanimanav ask your question.
[2020-05-03T15:37:33+0530] <hellozee> pushing things to limit, doesn't that sound like procrastination?
[2020-05-03T15:37:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> also hold your questions for later
[2020-05-03T15:37:35+0530] <insaanimanav> ideal time for meditation ?
[2020-05-03T15:37:42+0530] <hellozee> sorry, :(
[2020-05-03T15:37:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> hellozee, no worries
[2020-05-03T15:37:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> that was a general thing
[2020-05-03T15:38:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> hellozee, i am sending you a job offer tat you need some time to process
[2020-05-03T15:38:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> probably a day or two
[2020-05-03T15:38:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> the hr exec says they need an answer in the next 4 hours
[2020-05-03T15:38:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> is that procrastination?
[2020-05-03T15:38:44+0530] <hellozee> no
[2020-05-03T15:39:04+0530] <jasonbraganza> and i have to go. be back in 10!
[2020-05-03T15:39:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> really sorry folks
[2020-05-03T15:39:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> but chill a while :)
[2020-05-03T15:39:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> and let it all sink in
[2020-05-03T15:39:26+0530] <RJ722> jasonbraganza: no worries. we'll wait. thank you for doing this! :)
[2020-05-03T15:39:29+0530] <BhaveshSGupta> jasonbraganza, its okay
[2020-05-03T15:39:37+0530] <insaanimanav> I guess until we can think about all the truth bombs jasonbraganza
[2020-05-03T15:45:12+0530] <RJ722> I guess, now that we have some time, I can chime in and take over the stage to show you folks this -- https://ncase.me/mental-health/
[2020-05-03T15:46:11+0530] <RJ722> Biggest takeaway was that if you are trying to start a new habit (like meditation), don't plan for a time window greater than 5-10 mins initially. Keep it as low as possible.
[2020-05-03T15:47:08+0530] <RJ722> Second was, having a WHEN->THEN strategy, e.g., "After showering, I would meditate for 5 mins" is better than "I would meditate for 5 mins today"
[2020-05-03T15:48:30+0530] <RJ722> Another great learning: It takes a long time to form a habit. Only push from smaller time to larger windows much later. It takes, on average, 66 days of continous work to form a habbit. (see blog for more details)
[2020-05-03T15:49:03+0530] <RJ722> That's all from my side. Hope it helps!
[2020-05-03T15:50:41+0530] <sourabhdeshmukh> RJ722:  Thank you :)
[2020-05-03T15:50:43+0530] <j605> RJ722: thank you for the summary
[2020-05-03T15:51:14+0530] <hellozee> RJ722: thanks, that article has some nice points, :D
[2020-05-03T15:51:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> back
[2020-05-03T15:51:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> hello hello people!
[2020-05-03T15:52:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> so plan your life with intention
[2020-05-03T15:52:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> i want to do this in 6 months
[2020-05-03T15:52:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> and go there in 5
[2020-05-03T15:52:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> and be at the top of the heap in 10
[2020-05-03T15:53:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> it does not matter what
[2020-05-03T15:53:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> SET A DIRECTION
[2020-05-03T15:53:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> it’s not like all those goals are set in stone anyway
[2020-05-03T15:53:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> you can change them
[2020-05-03T15:53:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> but not on a whim
[2020-05-03T15:53:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> rocket man today
[2020-05-03T15:54:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> janitor tomorrow
[2020-05-03T15:54:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> doctor day after
[2020-05-03T15:54:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> like my 5 year old niece 
[2020-05-03T15:54:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> do what you have to, with some thought put in to it
[2020-05-03T15:54:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> am i here?
[2020-05-03T15:55:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> folk just say hello
[2020-05-03T15:55:06+0530] <RJ722> Yes
[2020-05-03T15:55:06+0530] <j605> hello
[2020-05-03T15:55:11+0530] <RJ722> Hello, hello
[2020-05-03T15:55:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> aah ok
[2020-05-03T15:55:13+0530] <hellozee> yes
[2020-05-03T15:55:20+0530] <priyankasaggu119> hello
[2020-05-03T15:55:39+0530] <nabarun> hi
[2020-05-03T15:55:39+0530] <bhavin192> Hello, I clicked on leave by mistake
[2020-05-03T15:55:43+0530] <sourabhdeshmukh> hello
[2020-05-03T15:55:44+0530] <pradhvan> Hello :)
[2020-05-03T15:55:47+0530] <ssurbhi> hello!
[2020-05-03T15:55:58+0530] <@kushal> everyone else please stop.
[2020-05-03T15:56:01+0530] <@kushal> jasonbraganza, please continue.
[2020-05-03T15:59:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok i am back
[2020-05-03T15:59:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> of course this has to happen on a day that i talk about time management XD
[2020-05-03T15:59:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> if this happens again, just give me 10 and i will switch isps and machines
[2020-05-03T15:59:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> so where was i?
[2020-05-03T15:59:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> yes intention
[2020-05-03T16:00:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> set goels
[2020-05-03T16:00:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> and plan them
[2020-05-03T16:00:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> it costs nothing to plan
[2020-05-03T16:00:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> and once something like a plan takes shape, you are motivated a lot more, to give it importance
[2020-05-03T16:00:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> and work at it
[2020-05-03T16:03:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> darn it
[2020-05-03T16:03:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok new machine
[2020-05-03T16:03:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> backup internet
[2020-05-03T16:03:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> hope this holds :)
[2020-05-03T16:03:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> what was the last thing you folks read?
[2020-05-03T16:04:02+0530] <bhavin192> <jasonbraganza> and work at it
[2020-05-03T16:04:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> aah ok
[2020-05-03T16:04:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> Abby and I planned for 3 cities over a week in Europe to fulfill our bucket list
[2020-05-03T16:05:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> it took us two years, but the plan we did and re did
[2020-05-03T16:05:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> succeeded spectacularly
[2020-05-03T16:05:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> we did 5 *countries* in a month
[2020-05-03T16:06:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> so there! :)
[2020-05-03T16:06:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> once you have a plan, you can then start taking small steps
[2020-05-03T16:06:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> and do it
[2020-05-03T16:06:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> this part every one is familiar with
[2020-05-03T16:06:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> the thing most people do not have is feedback and review
[2020-05-03T16:07:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> make sure that when you work towards your goals, you keep getting feedback from your plan
[2020-05-03T16:07:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> and make sure you keep reviewing it regularly
[2020-05-03T16:08:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> that will keep you on track
[2020-05-03T16:08:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> an example would be my goal to lose weight
[2020-05-03T16:08:42+0530] <jasonbraganza> who reads my weekly fitblr posts on mastodon?
[2020-05-03T16:08:55+0530] <priyankasaggu119> me
[2020-05-03T16:08:58+0530] <hellozee> me
[2020-05-03T16:09:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> so the scale does not lie
[2020-05-03T16:09:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> that is feedback
[2020-05-03T16:09:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> you ate this much
[2020-05-03T16:09:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> you exercised that much
[2020-05-03T16:09:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is the result
[2020-05-03T16:09:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> or code
[2020-05-03T16:09:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> you miss a semicolon
[2020-05-03T16:09:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> åhat is immedi
[2020-05-03T16:09:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> sorry
[2020-05-03T16:10:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> the code does not compile
[2020-05-03T16:10:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> immediate feedback
[2020-05-03T16:10:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> so look for feedback in everything you work at
[2020-05-03T16:10:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> and keep reviewing like i do
[2020-05-03T16:10:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> is this working
[2020-05-03T16:10:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> are we on track
[2020-05-03T16:10:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> do we need to change things
[2020-05-03T16:10:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> with me so far?
[2020-05-03T16:11:05+0530] <RJ722> !
[2020-05-03T16:11:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> later RJ722 :)
[2020-05-03T16:11:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> either write them all down or put them in that pad
[2020-05-03T16:11:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> goes to all you folks
[2020-05-03T16:12:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> we’ll break at 4.30 for 5 and i'll answer questions then
[2020-05-03T16:12:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> pay with money or time?
[2020-05-03T16:12:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> did you folks get that?
[2020-05-03T16:12:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> or did the internet eat those lines up?
[2020-05-03T16:13:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> earlier?
[2020-05-03T16:13:03+0530] <j605> (we got it)
[2020-05-03T16:13:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> aah ok
[2020-05-03T16:13:14+0530] <brute4s99> internet .
[2020-05-03T16:13:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> so just to reiterate
[2020-05-03T16:13:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> you pay with money
[2020-05-03T16:13:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> or you pay with time
[2020-05-03T16:13:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> in life, you always pay
[2020-05-03T16:14:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> so be intentional about how you spend your time
[2020-05-03T16:14:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> if it is something not important
[2020-05-03T16:14:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> see if you can spend the money and delegate it off
[2020-05-03T16:14:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> of course, when we start out, we all pay with time :)
[2020-05-03T16:14:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> so that is what money is for.
[2020-05-03T16:14:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> to save you time
[2020-05-03T16:15:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> to do the things you want to do
[2020-05-03T16:15:42+0530] <jasonbraganza> boredom is another point i want to highlight
[2020-05-03T16:15:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> be ok with being bored
[2020-05-03T16:15:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> be ok with slogging
[2020-05-03T16:16:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> meditation should help develop this too
[2020-05-03T16:16:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you are always chasing the new shiny, you will always be circling the drain
[2020-05-03T16:16:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> never getting anything of worth done
[2020-05-03T16:16:45+0530] <jasonbraganza> Motivation
[2020-05-03T16:16:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> who looks for motivation to do work here?
[2020-05-03T16:17:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> no one! such a good bunch!
[2020-05-03T16:17:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> i used to be motivated
[2020-05-03T16:17:40+0530] <RJ722> Here, as in?
[2020-05-03T16:17:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> in this channel :)
[2020-05-03T16:18:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> so i would get super motivated
[2020-05-03T16:18:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> do stuff 
[2020-05-03T16:18:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> lose motivation
[2020-05-03T16:18:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> then be motivated to do something else
[2020-05-03T16:18:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> and on and on
[2020-05-03T16:18:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> never got anything done
[2020-05-03T16:18:39+0530] <j605> > if you are always chasing the new shiny <- I have been avoiding this for the last 6 months or so
[2020-05-03T16:18:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> be ok with boredom
[2020-05-03T16:18:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> be ok with doing the work slowly
[2020-05-03T16:19:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> build habits
[2020-05-03T16:19:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> motivation does not last
[2020-05-03T16:19:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> but habits do
[2020-05-03T16:19:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> i get up every morning
[2020-05-03T16:19:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> go weigh myself
[2020-05-03T16:19:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> defrost the fridge
[2020-05-03T16:19:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> write in kushal's best thing journal
[2020-05-03T16:19:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> do my french review
[2020-05-03T16:19:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> hit the potty
[2020-05-03T16:19:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> brew
[2020-05-03T16:20:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> coffee
[2020-05-03T16:20:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> sit to study
[2020-05-03T16:20:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> i stacked these habits 
[2020-05-03T16:20:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> slowly
[2020-05-03T16:20:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> one on top of the other
[2020-05-03T16:20:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> even with studies
[2020-05-03T16:20:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> i started with 30 minutes of focussed work
[2020-05-03T16:20:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> and would then struggle
[2020-05-03T16:21:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> but this builds on itslef
[2020-05-03T16:21:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> i cannot program for long because i have not put in the work
[2020-05-03T16:21:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> but i can study now for 7 hours straight with two breaks thrown in
[2020-05-03T16:21:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> like kushal keeps teaching me.
[2020-05-03T16:21:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> slow and steady wints
[2020-05-03T16:21:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> wins
[2020-05-03T16:22:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> to get stuff done
[2020-05-03T16:22:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> make it a habit
[2020-05-03T16:22:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> tactics can always change
[2020-05-03T16:22:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> but the principles above dont
[2020-05-03T16:23:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> learn to meditate - have goals - plan for them - work at them - have feedback and review
[2020-05-03T16:23:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> two more important principles
[2020-05-03T16:23:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> have margin
[2020-05-03T16:23:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> and have optionality
[2020-05-03T16:23:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> everywhere
[2020-05-03T16:24:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> read the on margin article for that
[2020-05-03T16:24:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> what i mean
[2020-05-03T16:24:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> is build slack into your life
[2020-05-03T16:24:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> no need to live paycheck to paycheck
[2020-05-03T16:24:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> no need to have back to back meetings
[2020-05-03T16:24:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> put in cushions in terms of time and money into every single thing you do
[2020-05-03T16:25:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> iike i thought i would be done by now. 
[2020-05-03T16:25:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> and i still budgeted 3 hours
[2020-05-03T16:25:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> thank god i did!
[2020-05-03T16:25:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> optionality means look for options every where you go
[2020-05-03T16:26:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> i don't have to do this, what else can i do
[2020-05-03T16:26:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> i dont buy a non refundable tickte. i want the option to cancel it at any time
[2020-05-03T16:26:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> any one stuck with non refundable tickets ath this time?
[2020-05-03T16:26:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> ouch if you do :)
[2020-05-03T16:27:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> and be ok with things failing
[2020-05-03T16:27:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> be ok with thing falling
[2020-05-03T16:27:26+0530] • hellozee: raises his hand
[2020-05-03T16:27:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> be ok with not being able to do things
[2020-05-03T16:27:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> the important thing
[2020-05-03T16:27:49+0530] <jasonbraganza> is to just dust yourself off
[2020-05-03T16:27:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> think of it as violent feedback
[2020-05-03T16:27:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> :)
[2020-05-03T16:28:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> review what happened 
[2020-05-03T16:28:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> and then decide your next action
[2020-05-03T16:28:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> all with me so far?
[2020-05-03T16:28:59+0530] <j605> yes

[2020-05-03T16:36:47+0530] • pradhvan: waves back 
[2020-05-03T16:37:15+0530] • priyankasaggu119: says hi
[2020-05-03T16:37:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T16:37:19+0530] <batul> RJ722 ask your question.
[2020-05-03T16:37:36+0530] <RJ722> Give me a minute, please
[2020-05-03T16:37:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T16:37:42+0530] <batul> No one is in the queue.
[2020-05-03T16:37:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> aah ok
[2020-05-03T16:37:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> any one else wants to ask anything?
[2020-05-03T16:38:07+0530] <bhavin192> There are few questions on pad as well.
[2020-05-03T16:38:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> on the ground we cover so far?
[2020-05-03T16:38:42+0530] <RJ722> You said that you continually gather feedback, and adjust your goals accordingly. In my experience, I've generally seen that it reduces the scope.
[2020-05-03T16:38:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> bhavin192, thank you. i thing i will cove that later
[2020-05-03T16:38:58+0530] <RJ722> When do you know that you need to increase it?
[2020-05-03T16:39:12+0530] <RJ722> Like you did with your holidays
[2020-05-03T16:39:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> RJ722, you want to reduce scope for the most part
[2020-05-03T16:39:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> and when you do that
[2020-05-03T16:39:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> you either feel stifled and look for options
[2020-05-03T16:39:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> or you see possibilities like we did and it automatically expands
[2020-05-03T16:40:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> when you’re in the weeds, doing the work, you will automatically know
[2020-05-03T16:40:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> does that help?
[2020-05-03T16:40:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> so shall we continue
[2020-05-03T16:40:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> ?
[2020-05-03T16:40:52+0530] <RJ722> Got it.
[2020-05-03T16:41:09+0530] <RJ722>  jasonbraganza: thanks!
[2020-05-03T16:41:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> so start with what you generally want out of life, build something concrete and work towards it
[2020-05-03T16:41:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> that leads me to The Most Important Thing
[2020-05-03T16:42:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> do The Most Important Thing, when you are at your best
[2020-05-03T16:42:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> either first thing in the morning
[2020-05-03T16:42:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> or late at night at your productive hours in case you are a night owl
[2020-05-03T16:42:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> have a Most Important Thing
[2020-05-03T16:43:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you have your goals set and planned, you will have actions to do
[2020-05-03T16:43:45+0530] <jasonbraganza> and you will know what is Important
[2020-05-03T16:44:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you are just spinning your wheels, you might not
[2020-05-03T16:44:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> but even so you will
[2020-05-03T16:44:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> bhavin192, what is the most important thing you will do tomorrow? same with all you folks?
[2020-05-03T16:44:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> what is it that will drive you to what you want?
[2020-05-03T16:45:32+0530] <j605> I have an important $work demo in the evening so I would be preparing for it in the morning
[2020-05-03T16:45:37+0530] <RJ722> jasonbraganza: think about my plans.
[2020-05-03T16:45:53+0530] <RJ722> jasonbraganza: as in I'd be thinking about my plans.
[2020-05-03T16:46:07+0530] <sidntrivedi> jasonbraganza: Getting up early in morning.
[2020-05-03T16:46:13+0530] <hellozee> a couple of assignments, the deadline is in a couple of days
[2020-05-03T16:46:24+0530] <priyankasaggu119> exercise
[2020-05-03T16:46:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> there you go.
[2020-05-03T16:47:20+0530] <sourabhdeshmukh> plan out the goals and deadlines
[2020-05-03T16:47:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> for folks who have reactive important thing thrust upon them from outside, slowly start to work at developing your own
[2020-05-03T16:47:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> or the world (your boss, the professor, the company) will do it for you
[2020-05-03T16:48:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> i have given you enough principles
[2020-05-03T16:49:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> let's try a framework to hang them on
[2020-05-03T16:49:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> how do you plan your day / week / month
[2020-05-03T16:49:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> and then when i am done, if time permits i will share a few more tactics and principles
[2020-05-03T16:50:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> so before i begin
[2020-05-03T16:50:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> here is one important principle
[2020-05-03T16:50:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> don't treat your brain like a cupboard
[2020-05-03T16:50:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> don't store anything in there
[2020-05-03T16:50:42+0530] <jasonbraganza> use it to think
[2020-05-03T16:51:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> everything else goes down into a database/note/diary of some sort
[2020-05-03T16:51:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> if anyone has done gtd
[2020-05-03T16:52:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> you will recognise these as the principles underlying them
[2020-05-03T16:52:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> you don't have to be a gtd person to get this. take the principles
[2020-05-03T16:52:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> and adapt them to your situation as you see fit
[2020-05-03T16:52:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> so here we go
[2020-05-03T16:53:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> 1. identify goals (they are not set in stone) short term? long term?
[2020-05-03T16:53:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> 2. gather all your thoughts and dump them out
[2020-05-03T16:53:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> 3. process them all
[2020-05-03T16:53:45+0530] <jasonbraganza> 4. organise them
[2020-05-03T16:53:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> 5. do them
[2020-05-03T16:54:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> 6. review them
[2020-05-03T16:54:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> and that is all there is to it
[2020-05-03T16:54:31+0530] <jasonbraganza> it's basically everything i spoke above
[2020-05-03T16:54:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> in a tidy little package
[2020-05-03T16:55:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> so step 1 and 2 and 3 are normally half yearly / yearly things
[2020-05-03T16:55:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> 4 and 6 should happen weekly
[2020-05-03T16:55:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> 5 should happend daily :)
[2020-05-03T16:56:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> so lets have a guinea pig
[2020-05-03T16:56:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> any one wants to do this with me?
[2020-05-03T16:56:29+0530] <brute4s99> me
[2020-05-03T16:56:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok brute4s99 lets do this
[2020-05-03T16:57:04+0530] <jasonbraganza> give me a hypothetical goal
[2020-05-03T16:57:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> or a real one
[2020-05-03T16:57:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> any will do
[2020-05-03T16:57:26+0530] <brute4s99> get a remote job in Germany
[2020-05-03T16:57:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> think about the time frame
[2020-05-03T16:57:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> when?
[2020-05-03T16:57:51+0530] <brute4s99> 10 months should be enough
[2020-05-03T16:58:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok
[2020-05-03T16:58:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> that is the goal we are working toward
[2020-05-03T16:58:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> what else is happeing in your life right now?
[2020-05-03T16:58:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> what do you do on a daily basis
[2020-05-03T16:58:44+0530] <brute4s99> internship, free software contributions
[2020-05-03T16:58:54+0530] <brute4s99> and games and YouTube 😅
[2020-05-03T16:59:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> any of them help you towards getting that job
[2020-05-03T16:59:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> ?
[2020-05-03T16:59:23+0530] <brute4s99> free software contributions and internship, I think
[2020-05-03T16:59:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you think then you are not sure
[2020-05-03T16:59:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> you need to research a bit and plan more
[2020-05-03T17:00:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> if this was not needed for the job, then would you still do them?
[2020-05-03T17:00:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> you need to be quicker brute4s99 :)
[2020-05-03T17:00:42+0530] <brute4s99> contributions? yes
[2020-05-03T17:00:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> so that implies a bigger goal.
[2020-05-03T17:00:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> what is that?
[2020-05-03T17:01:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> *or a different goal
[2020-05-03T17:01:16+0530] <brute4s99> I want to improve my C++/Qt game
[2020-05-03T17:01:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> so now we have two goals
[2020-05-03T17:01:42+0530] <jasonbraganza> so how much time do you want to give them daily?
[2020-05-03T17:01:57+0530] <brute4s99> 2 hours
[2020-05-03T17:02:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> how long before your C++ skills improve to where you want them to be?
[2020-05-03T17:02:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> 2 hours each?
[2020-05-03T17:02:36+0530] <brute4s99> 2 hours to contributions and 4 to internship, should be enough for the next 3 months
[2020-05-03T17:02:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> see how this is turning more concrete?
[2020-05-03T17:03:13+0530] <brute4s99> yess
[2020-05-03T17:03:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> so what specifically are you doing for internship and contributions?
[2020-05-03T17:03:50+0530] <brute4s99> I'm working from home, working with QML and little bits of C++ at internship and working on Qt and C++ at KDE
[2020-05-03T17:03:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> so basically this is step 1 and 2 and 3 in action
[2020-05-03T17:04:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> brute4s99, that is very hazy. how will you know that your QML skills are up to par?
[2020-05-03T17:04:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> if we are adults, like kushal and i are
[2020-05-03T17:05:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> this could take 2-3 days the first time we do it
[2020-05-03T17:05:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> because we not only have goals
[2020-05-03T17:05:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> we also have responsibilities 
[2020-05-03T17:05:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> and obligations
[2020-05-03T17:05:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> so the thing to do is to list them all down
[2020-05-03T17:05:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> slowly
[2020-05-03T17:05:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> write them
[2020-05-03T17:05:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> gather them and write them down
[2020-05-03T17:06:06+0530] <brute4s99> okay
[2020-05-03T17:06:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> and once they are all on paper
[2020-05-03T17:06:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> we start processing them
[2020-05-03T17:06:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> there is this thing to do
[2020-05-03T17:06:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> there is my childs admission
[2020-05-03T17:06:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> moms insurance
[2020-05-03T17:07:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> i want to be a successful blogger so that i can do more outreach
[2020-05-03T17:07:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> this goes here
[2020-05-03T17:07:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> that goes there
[2020-05-03T17:07:59+0530] <brute4s99> okay
[2020-05-03T17:08:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> and once that is done
[2020-05-03T17:08:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> we start organising and prioritising them
[2020-05-03T17:08:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> now that i know there was so much in my head
[2020-05-03T17:08:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> and there is so much to do
[2020-05-03T17:08:51+0530] <brute4s99> !
[2020-05-03T17:08:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> and it is all before me
[2020-05-03T17:09:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> what can i do
[2020-05-03T17:09:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> what is important
[2020-05-03T17:09:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> what is urgent
[2020-05-03T17:09:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> what can i pay someone to do
[2020-05-03T17:10:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> what can someone else help me with
[2020-05-03T17:10:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> organised
[2020-05-03T17:10:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> once this is all organised
[2020-05-03T17:10:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> you prioritise them
[2020-05-03T17:11:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is a short term goal. but i am not interested. i'll push it to some day later
[2020-05-03T17:11:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is important. it will take a long time. i will break it up into smaller actions and put them on my calendar
[2020-05-03T17:11:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is urgent. it needs to be done? can someone do this for me? yes, good
[2020-05-03T17:12:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is also urgent, but i have to do this myself, put this on the calendar
[2020-05-03T17:12:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> as you prioritise, you realise that you will need to push a lot of your stuff to some other time
[2020-05-03T17:13:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> that is ok
[2020-05-03T17:13:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> as you finish your goals, you will come back to your list and pick it up
[2020-05-03T17:13:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> again
[2020-05-03T17:13:49+0530] <jasonbraganza> or realise that you don't want to do it and you will scratch it off
[2020-05-03T17:14:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> no that you have your goals and plans prioritised
[2020-05-03T17:14:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> start breaking them down.
[2020-05-03T17:15:04+0530] <jasonbraganza> a thing that helps me is to give important, but long term plans due dates
[2020-05-03T17:15:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> this part has to be done by this date
[2020-05-03T17:15:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> that thing has to be done by that date
[2020-05-03T17:15:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> once you break them down into small plans
[2020-05-03T17:15:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> you can get even smaller and break them into action steps
[2020-05-03T17:15:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> i want to go to europe
[2020-05-03T17:16:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> when
[2020-05-03T17:16:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> 2018
[2020-05-03T17:16:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> (we dreamt this is 2016)
[2020-05-03T17:16:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> is this important?
[2020-05-03T17:16:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> well, we both have life threatening sicknessee and don't know the future
[2020-05-03T17:16:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> so yea
[2020-05-03T17:16:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok then what needs be done?
[2020-05-03T17:17:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> research
[2020-05-03T17:17:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> see how much it costs
[2020-05-03T17:17:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> see where we want to go
[2020-05-03T17:17:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> figure out everything on paper
[2020-05-03T17:17:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> and start saving
[2020-05-03T17:17:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> how long for research
[2020-05-03T17:17:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> a week
[2020-05-03T17:17:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok
[2020-05-03T17:17:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> a week later
[2020-05-03T17:17:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> we have a tentative plan and costs
[2020-05-03T17:18:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> so what next
[2020-05-03T17:18:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is how much we need in total
[2020-05-03T17:18:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is how much is works out to monthly
[2020-05-03T17:18:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> we should have this much extra as margin
[2020-05-03T17:18:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> and that brings it to this much extra monthly
[2020-05-03T17:19:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok
[2020-05-03T17:19:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> so all wee need to do is save monthly for two years?
[2020-05-03T17:19:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> yea
[2020-05-03T17:19:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> what is the next step? check in august the year before and start booking things like we planned
[2020-05-03T17:19:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok
[2020-05-03T17:19:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> 2 years pass with us saving
[2020-05-03T17:20:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> sometimes her chemo would come up
[2020-05-03T17:20:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> and we could not save
[2020-05-03T17:20:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> but since we knew what to do, we found something ore the other to do
[2020-05-03T17:20:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> i worked extra (willingly, because i know what i wanted to do)
[2020-05-03T17:21:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> and in august we start
[2020-05-03T17:21:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> with the next phase 
[2020-05-03T17:21:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> every booking goes smoothly
[2020-05-03T17:21:49+0530] <jasonbraganza> we keep reviewing for hiccups
[2020-05-03T17:21:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> nope none
[2020-05-03T17:22:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> and we are on our way
[2020-05-03T17:22:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> and at the airport we are told we cannot fly
[2020-05-03T17:22:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> because my agent screwed up
[2020-05-03T17:22:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> so this is where margin and meditation come in handy
[2020-05-03T17:23:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> i know i have money to book us an emergency flight
[2020-05-03T17:23:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> so i am not worried
[2020-05-03T17:23:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> but i call up the agent and tell them to fix it
[2020-05-03T17:23:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> two hours later, we are booked on alternate flights and we kick the biggest item off our bucket list!
[2020-05-03T17:24:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> so that is how we did it
[2020-05-03T17:24:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> in the meanwhile
[2020-05-03T17:24:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> every month
[2020-05-03T17:24:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> we would review the plan
[2020-05-03T17:24:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> were we on track 
[2020-05-03T17:24:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> were we saving properly?
[2020-05-03T17:24:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> was it time  to do this?
[2020-05-03T17:24:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> was it time to do that?
[2020-05-03T17:25:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> and then go back to adjusting and doing it
[2020-05-03T17:25:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> system
[2020-05-03T17:25:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> identify goals (they are not set in stone) short term? long term?
[2020-05-03T17:25:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> gather all your thoughts and dump them out
[2020-05-03T17:25:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> process them all
[2020-05-03T17:25:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> organise them
[2020-05-03T17:25:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> review them
[2020-05-03T17:25:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> do them
[2020-05-03T17:25:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> so in a nutshell again ^
[2020-05-03T17:25:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> but that was just one goal
[2020-05-03T17:26:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> we have several others going in tandem.
[2020-05-03T17:26:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> our treatments
[2020-05-03T17:26:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> our careers
[2020-05-03T17:26:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> so the thing is to have you priorities right. break them into plans
[2020-05-03T17:26:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> and then work on them daily. review them weekly
[2020-05-03T17:27:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> and have a big goal review quarterly / half yearly / yearly
[2020-05-03T17:27:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> is this thing we are working on, on track?
[2020-05-03T17:27:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> do we add another goal to work on?
[2020-05-03T17:27:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> and so on
[2020-05-03T17:27:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> everyone with me so far?
[2020-05-03T17:28:10+0530] • priyankasaggu119: yes
[2020-05-03T17:28:12+0530] <sourabhdeshmukh> yup
[2020-05-03T17:28:27+0530] <@kushal> yes
[2020-05-03T17:28:32+0530] <RJ722> yes
[2020-05-03T17:28:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> now you could use gtd / obm / x methodology
[2020-05-03T17:29:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> but it all boils to the same thing. have goals break them down. work at them. ensure you have feedback. ensure you have review. and get them done
[2020-05-03T17:29:57+0530] • zleap: agrees
[2020-05-03T17:30:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> i assume folks have questions?
[2020-05-03T17:30:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T17:30:16+0530] <batul> brute4s99 ask your question.
[2020-05-03T17:30:32+0530] • jasonbraganza: also goes to check the pad
[2020-05-03T17:31:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> Q. Regarding options, I sometimes end up with a feeling of not wanting to tackle the options that I have currently and go on to passive consumption. I guess this is more of a personal problem but I guess building habbits should help here.
[2020-05-03T17:31:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> that was the first one
[2020-05-03T17:31:41+0530] <brute4s99> jasonbraganza:  yes, I just wanted to say that I keep sticky notes at a wall for all my weekly tasks. I think my long term goals are few so I can keep them in my head. Does that make sense?
[2020-05-03T17:32:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok questioner, maybe by now you should be clearer?
[2020-05-03T17:32:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> break them down into the smallest possible pieces
[2020-05-03T17:32:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> set a really low bar
[2020-05-03T17:32:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> until it forms a habit, yes
[2020-05-03T17:33:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> brute4s99, which part of don't use your head for storage, did you not get? :)
[2020-05-03T17:33:12+0530] <j605> jasonbraganza: yes! I went ahead and mowed my pending tasks list to make it less intimidating and into things I really want to do. also prioritizing more so I actually tackle them. thanks!
[2020-05-03T17:33:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> brute4s99, i probably have 20 years on you. i can confidently tell you with all the things i have done wrong that your head and your memory and your feelings are fallible
[2020-05-03T17:34:02+0530] <jasonbraganza> write it down
[2020-05-03T17:34:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> look at it every day
[2020-05-03T17:34:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> and soon you will either do it. or ditch it
[2020-05-03T17:34:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> j605, excellent!
[2020-05-03T17:34:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> Q. Does working at night reduce our efficiency and harms our health than working at day? If yes, how to get up early in the morning and do work?
[2020-05-03T17:35:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> honestly speaking, i don't know how the body works.
[2020-05-03T17:35:11+0530] <brute4s99> jasonbraganza: okay 😅
[2020-05-03T17:35:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> but yes, the body is mostly diurnal
[2020-05-03T17:35:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> so better to work in the day
[2020-05-03T17:35:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you do your best work at night, who am i to force you otherwise?
[2020-05-03T17:35:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> saptaks is a night owl
[2020-05-03T17:36:02+0530] <@saptaks> :P
[2020-05-03T17:36:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> the point is to do your work, *and* get enough rest
[2020-05-03T17:36:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> you need your sleep
[2020-05-03T17:36:29+0530] • saptaks: agrees
[2020-05-03T17:36:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> you can't work day AND night
[2020-05-03T17:36:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> that is a sure fire way to end up broken like me
[2020-05-03T17:36:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> Q. I have chosen Saturday and Sunday to write my weekly blogpost. Is it fine or should I write some parts daily?
[2020-05-03T17:37:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> it depends on how you work
[2020-05-03T17:37:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you cannot do sustained focus
[2020-05-03T17:37:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> best to do a little daily
[2020-05-03T17:37:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you can sit down for an hour or two and crank out a post, do it on the weekend
[2020-05-03T17:38:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> practice makes perfect
[2020-05-03T17:38:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> Q. How much time should we dedicate to our hobbies (Eg: Reading, playing music instrument, gardening etc.) daily?
[2020-05-03T17:38:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> have a judicious balance.
[2020-05-03T17:38:49+0530] <jasonbraganza> hobbies are where all our ideas and creativity come from
[2020-05-03T17:39:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> and it needs to be an *active* hobby
[2020-05-03T17:39:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> like the ones you pointed out
[2020-05-03T17:39:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> watching netflix does not count
[2020-05-03T17:39:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> the need to work on your personal goals and hobbies is why we do all this
[2020-05-03T17:40:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> we set our goals and our plans to know how much time we have free
[2020-05-03T17:40:21+0530] <insaanimanav> @jason
[2020-05-03T17:40:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> if there is no time at all in the day
[2020-05-03T17:40:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> something has to go
[2020-05-03T17:40:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> down the list
[2020-05-03T17:40:43+0530] <insaanimanav> !
[2020-05-03T17:40:50+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T17:40:51+0530] <batul> insaanimanav ask your question.
[2020-05-03T17:41:03+0530] <insaanimanav> just one teensy thing do you guys have a log for this talk ?
[2020-05-03T17:41:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> all those in favour of a log say aye
[2020-05-03T17:41:30+0530] <insaanimanav> because I would love to go back to this
[2020-05-03T17:41:31+0530] <@kushal> insaanimanav, it will be available later tonight if jasonbraganza wants.
[2020-05-03T17:41:35+0530] <insaanimanav> yay

[2020-05-03T17:42:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> three
[2020-05-03T17:42:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> four
[2020-05-03T17:42:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> any more
[2020-05-03T17:42:20+0530] <@kushal> say no at least
[2020-05-03T17:42:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> we still don't have a quorum
[2020-05-03T17:42:27+0530] <insaanimanav> do emotions count ?
[2020-05-03T17:42:27+0530] <j605> aye, since some might not have znc
[2020-05-03T17:42:32+0530] • priyankasaggu119: yes
[2020-05-03T17:42:36+0530] <bhavin192> yes
[2020-05-03T17:42:45+0530] <insaanimanav> I have strong emotions maybe count me twice XD
[2020-05-03T17:42:46+0530] <BhaveshSGupta> yes
[2020-05-03T17:42:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok we have a log
[2020-05-03T17:43:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> now

[2020-05-03T17:43:19+0530] <@kushal> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> i still have stuff to discuss
[2020-05-03T17:43:20+0530] <insaanimanav> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:23+0530] <priyankasaggu119> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:24+0530] <anwesha> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:26+0530] <j605> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:28+0530] <sourabhdeshmukh> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:28+0530] <sidntrivedi> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:32+0530] <pradhvan> Me
[2020-05-03T17:43:36+0530] <BhaveshSGupta> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:36+0530] <ssurbhi> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:40+0530] <nabarun> me
[2020-05-03T17:43:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> oh good
[2020-05-03T17:43:59+0530] <anwesha> jasonbraganza, I guess everyone
[2020-05-03T17:44:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> so let me just grab that last question :)
[2020-05-03T17:44:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> Q. How to deal with boredom while developing a habit ?
[2020-05-03T17:44:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> make it as small as possible
[2020-05-03T17:44:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> and once it becomes a habit, you will still get bored
[2020-05-03T17:44:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> but you should by then be stronger
[2020-05-03T17:44:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> Q. As a person who is into software, why should I read Non-Tech Books? I can give that time to reading more tech-related books and skilling up?
[2020-05-03T17:45:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> to whoever wrote this
[2020-05-03T17:45:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> i will leave it to other people to answer
[2020-05-03T17:45:46+0530] <@kushal> jasonbraganza, should we answer now or later?
[2020-05-03T17:45:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> asking a bookworm, specially a bookworm who applies his ideas
[2020-05-03T17:45:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> this
[2020-05-03T17:45:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> question
[2020-05-03T17:46:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> is patently stupid
[2020-05-03T17:46:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> kushal, now
[2020-05-03T17:46:19+0530] <@kushal> Reading books is very much personal.
[2020-05-03T17:46:44+0530] <@kushal> You choose what kind of books you like, and also decide why do you read books.
[2020-05-03T17:46:56+0530] <@kushal> I don't like fictions, but I read a lot of non-fictions.
[2020-05-03T17:47:08+0530] <@kushal> Including things nothing to do with technology.
[2020-05-03T17:47:21+0530] <insaanimanav> I would like to answer after kushal
[2020-05-03T17:47:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> if i had not read books, i would not be doing this session! teaching you about what i learnt.
[2020-05-03T17:47:27+0530] <@kushal> Reading more slowly helps to become a better writer.
[2020-05-03T17:47:33+0530] <j605> my mind opens up more with diverse books. reading has helped in ways that are not very direct. If you just want something qualitative, it will at least improve your vocabulary and language if you read from domains that generally wouldn't
[2020-05-03T17:47:38+0530] <@kushal> insaanimanav, keep typing, this is IRC.
[2020-05-03T17:47:52+0530] <insaanimanav> I mostly read non-tech books to maybe take a break . I like tech stuff . But just getting lost into another world is important (atleast for me)
[2020-05-03T17:47:54+0530] <anwesha> tech does not mean -life so technologists specially Indian technologists must read books. Since most of them do have any idea about life world or anything other than technology.
[2020-05-03T17:48:10+0530] <@kushal> anwesha, True that.
[2020-05-03T17:48:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok lets do the next one :)
[2020-05-03T17:48:19+0530] <bhavin192> What I feel is, it gives you a different perspective. Different perspective to look at life.
[2020-05-03T17:48:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> oh we're done
[2020-05-03T17:48:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> so let me continue
[2020-05-03T17:48:45+0530] <jasonbraganza> Procrastination!
[2020-05-03T17:49:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> could be due to lack of clarity
[2020-05-03T17:49:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> or lack of motivation
[2020-05-03T17:50:21+0530] <jasonbraganza> lack of clarity is easy to fix. find out more about the thing. and you will either actually want to do it or not
[2020-05-03T17:50:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> lack of motivation is tricky
[2020-05-03T17:51:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> my suggestion  would be to break the plan down to really tiny pieces
[2020-05-03T17:51:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> kushal has seen me last year
[2020-05-03T17:51:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> and he has seen a photo of me as i am now
[2020-05-03T17:51:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> kushal is there a big difference to your eyes?
[2020-05-03T17:51:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok kushal seems to be busy XD
[2020-05-03T17:52:03+0530] <@kushal> big is a small word.
[2020-05-03T17:52:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> but take my word for it
[2020-05-03T17:52:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> oh there he is :)
[2020-05-03T17:52:16+0530] <@kushal> There is DIFFERENCE.
[2020-05-03T17:52:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> i *hate* exercising
[2020-05-03T17:52:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> i *hate* having to watch what i eat
[2020-05-03T17:53:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> there is ZERO motivation for me to lose weight
[2020-05-03T17:53:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> a health scare will take you a few weeks
[2020-05-03T17:53:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> then what do you do?
[2020-05-03T17:53:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> which is why the goal on the fridge
[2020-05-03T17:53:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> i want to be the same weight i was when i was 22
[2020-05-03T17:53:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> 68kgs
[2020-05-03T17:54:03+0530] <jasonbraganza> i look at it for months
[2020-05-03T17:54:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> the weight did not budge for 3 months
[2020-05-03T17:54:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> but i stuck with it
[2020-05-03T17:54:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> i had my physio for feedback
[2020-05-03T17:54:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> to tell me that i was ding something wrong
[2020-05-03T17:54:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> or not
[2020-05-03T17:55:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> and i broke it down to tiny pieces
[2020-05-03T17:55:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> today i will not eat outside food
[2020-05-03T17:55:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> once i got used to that
[2020-05-03T17:55:29+0530] <jasonbraganza> then i will run for 2 min
[2020-05-03T17:55:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> once i got used to that
[2020-05-03T17:55:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> i will learn what carbs are about
[2020-05-03T17:55:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> then 
[2020-05-03T17:55:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> i will eat properly
[2020-05-03T17:56:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> thin i will run 5 mins daily
[2020-05-03T17:56:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> it was a series of small steps
[2020-05-03T17:56:31+0530] <jasonbraganza> sep i fell sick and lost 10kgs due to sickness
[2020-05-03T17:56:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> i was 97
[2020-05-03T17:56:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> i melted to 87
[2020-05-03T17:56:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> this was nov
[2020-05-03T17:57:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> when i was given the all clear
[2020-05-03T17:57:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> step by small step i got here
[2020-05-03T17:57:30+0530] <jasonbraganza> weight loss is the one thing i can tell you 
[2020-05-03T17:57:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> i absolutely hate every part of it
[2020-05-03T17:57:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> and i do it because they are habits now
[2020-05-03T17:58:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> today's weight is 72.4
[2020-05-03T17:58:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> 68 is not far off
[2020-05-03T17:59:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> so that is my story of lack of motivation and procrastination
[2020-05-03T17:59:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> the other two things for motivation are
[2020-05-03T17:59:42+0530] <jasonbraganza> 1 get healthy. do something physical for atleast 15 mins a day in the sun
[2020-05-03T17:59:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> and check your nutrition
[2020-05-03T18:00:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> your physical and mental health count for a lot
[2020-05-03T18:00:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> priyankasaggu119, back me up here!
[2020-05-03T18:00:33+0530] <priyankasaggu119> A big yes!
[2020-05-03T18:00:40+0530] <priyankasaggu119> YES
[2020-05-03T18:00:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> from James Clear
[2020-05-03T18:01:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> Third Law of Motion:​ When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body. (i.e. Equal and opposite forces.)
[2020-05-03T18:01:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> There are productive forces in our lives like ​focus​, ​positivity​, and ​motivation​. There are also unproductive forces like ​stress​, ​lack of sleep​, and trying to juggle ​too many tasks at once​
[2020-05-03T18:01:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> either work on increasing the positives - power through stuff through sheer will power
[2020-05-03T18:02:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> or eliminate the negatives - simplify - say no - change your - environment - reduce what you take on
[2020-05-03T18:02:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> a good way to stay on track is to get accountability
[2020-05-03T18:03:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> my way to stay on track is to put my weight loss stuff on my mastodon
[2020-05-03T18:03:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> my way to stay on wrting is to absolutely do the weekly newsletter
[2020-05-03T18:03:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> write about it
[2020-05-03T18:03:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> or get someone to hold you accountable
[2020-05-03T18:04:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> or have a negative bet
[2020-05-03T18:04:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> you know, the one where if you lose, you have to give to a place you absolutely hate
[2020-05-03T18:04:18+0530] <zleap> sor just saying well done can make a difference
[2020-05-03T18:04:54+0530] <zleap> *or
[2020-05-03T18:05:04+0530] <jasonbraganza> eliminate multitasking!
[2020-05-03T18:05:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> one task at a time that is all you do
[2020-05-03T18:05:29+0530] • saptaks: runs away
[2020-05-03T18:05:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> please do not flit from one task to another and back to this
[2020-05-03T18:06:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> i can *guarantee* you will take longer at both instead of if you just did it one after another
[2020-05-03T18:06:57+0530] • sourabhdeshmukh: should avoid that.
[2020-05-03T18:07:12+0530] <jasonbraganza> you can do a ton if you just buckle down and do it
[2020-05-03T18:07:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> also focus comes faster
[2020-05-03T18:07:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> this also gets your work done quicker
[2020-05-03T18:07:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you don't have enough time in the day
[2020-05-03T18:07:55+0530] <jasonbraganza> break them into even smaller pieces
[2020-05-03T18:08:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> and do it daily / regularly
[2020-05-03T18:08:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> you will then get it done.
[2020-05-03T18:08:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> it will just take longer
[2020-05-03T18:08:41+0530] <@saptaks> !
[2020-05-03T18:08:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> this is for folks whose lives are variable
[2020-05-03T18:08:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> like kushal or me
[2020-05-03T18:08:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T18:08:55+0530] <batul> saptaks ask your question.
[2020-05-03T18:09:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> also for folks like us
[2020-05-03T18:10:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> set the bar low. if you do one thing a day? that you actually planned for and did - that's a win
[2020-05-03T18:10:19+0530] <@saptaks> jasonbraganza, when you say don't multitask and focus on one thing, do you mean don't do more than one thing till one of your goals is met, or divide parts of day into different slots and allocate them to different goals? Also sorry if you already answered this, I couldn't go through the entire history
[2020-05-03T18:10:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> the second part saptaks.
[2020-05-03T18:10:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> do one thing after another
[2020-05-03T18:10:56+0530] <@saptaks> jasonbraganza, got it.
[2020-05-03T18:11:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> you will ofcourse work at multiple goals at once :)
[2020-05-03T18:11:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> for busy folks, have one hour a day that is yours to do your Important thing
[2020-05-03T18:11:47+0530] <jasonbraganza> just one. you can make time
[2020-05-03T18:12:25+0530] <jasonbraganza> and if you do a hour a day and review at the end of the week/month, you will be amazed at what you actually get done
[2020-05-03T18:12:34+0530] <zleap> and I guess make time for proper breaks for food / drink, maybe do that and catch up on the news on TV for example.
[2020-05-03T18:12:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> Estimating time
[2020-05-03T18:12:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> err on the side of overestimating :) see margin above ^
[2020-05-03T18:13:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> your plans and your budgets will keep you on track hopefully
[2020-05-03T18:13:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> and this is the biggest thing i have learnt
[2020-05-03T18:14:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> we overestimate what we can do in a week
[2020-05-03T18:14:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> or a day
[2020-05-03T18:14:32+0530] <jasonbraganza> and underestimate what we can do in the long term.
[2020-05-03T18:14:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> in 6 months or a year
[2020-05-03T18:15:26+0530] <jasonbraganza> Prioritising
[2020-05-03T18:15:41+0530] <jasonbraganza> Warren Buffet had an interesting way to do it
[2020-05-03T18:15:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> make a list of things you want to do
[2020-05-03T18:16:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> make it long
[2020-05-03T18:16:13+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you want
[2020-05-03T18:16:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> then pick 5
[2020-05-03T18:16:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> and only work on those
[2020-05-03T18:16:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> the rest are your do not work on list XD
[2020-05-03T18:16:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> i am doing something similar this year
[2020-05-03T18:16:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> fitness
[2020-05-03T18:17:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> 12th standard
[2020-05-03T18:17:04+0530] <jasonbraganza> programming
[2020-05-03T18:17:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> everything else can wait
[2020-05-03T18:17:13+0530] <zleap> so rather than say having finish coding course, you would have do part 1 , part 2 etc and tick each one off
[2020-05-03T18:17:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> i was talking about the bigger goal prioritising process
[2020-05-03T18:18:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> i know folks here have trouble with choosing what to do
[2020-05-03T18:18:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> since we are spoilt for options
[2020-05-03T18:18:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> Have boxes where life can touch you
[2020-05-03T18:18:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> and nowhere eles
[2020-05-03T18:19:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> mine are email and mastodon
[2020-05-03T18:19:14+0530] <jasonbraganza> and my phone
[2020-05-03T18:19:24+0530] <jasonbraganza> depending on the person
[2020-05-03T18:19:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> nowhere else
[2020-05-03T18:19:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> my final point to end with
[2020-05-03T18:20:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> is learn to say NO
[2020-05-03T18:20:18+0530] • zleap: agrees there too
[2020-05-03T18:20:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> No is a decision. Yes is a responsibility.
[2020-05-03T18:20:33+0530] <jasonbraganza> “Every time we say yes to a request, we are also saying no to anything else we might accomplish with the time.”
[2020-05-03T18:20:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> James Clear ^
[2020-05-03T18:20:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> if you say no, it is done and dusted.
[2020-05-03T18:21:09+0530] <jasonbraganza> say yes and you are loaded with another burden
[2020-05-03T18:21:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> choose your Yes’ very very carefully!
[2020-05-03T18:21:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> “If I had to do this today, would I agree to it?” If an opportunity is exciting enough to drop whatever you're doing right now, then it's a yes. If it's not, then perhaps you should think twice.
[2020-05-03T18:21:54+0530] <jasonbraganza> James Clear ^
[2020-05-03T18:22:15+0530] <jasonbraganza> always say, not now
[2020-05-03T18:22:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> maybe later
[2020-05-03T18:22:40+0530] <jasonbraganza> like i mentioned in the beginning develop the mental muscle
[2020-05-03T18:22:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> to say no
[2020-05-03T18:22:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> or to delay things that you don't want to say yes to
[2020-05-03T18:23:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> i had a trick in my computer engineer days
[2020-05-03T18:23:17+0530] <jasonbraganza> someone would call with an issue
[2020-05-03T18:23:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> i would tell them i was busy with another client and that i'd call them in 10 mins
[2020-05-03T18:23:39+0530] <zleap> thing is saying maybe later, people will end up keep pestering you with that,  so saying NO gives them a clear answer there and then
[2020-05-03T18:24:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> more often than not the problem would be sorted without me doing a thing :)
[2020-05-03T18:24:24+0530] <insaanimanav>  what about people getting offended when hearing a straight no
[2020-05-03T18:24:39+0530] <jasonbraganza> what about them?
[2020-05-03T18:24:42+0530] <@kushal> insaanimanav, please type ! if you have a question.
[2020-05-03T18:24:44+0530] <insaanimanav> Like I thought you were my friend or I was really counting onn you
[2020-05-03T18:25:06+0530] <insaanimanav> should we just carry on when people get offended by a straight no ?
[2020-05-03T18:25:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> did you hear what kushal said insaanimanav?
[2020-05-03T18:25:29+0530] <insaanimanav> ya I did

[2020-05-03T18:27:06+0530] <jasonbraganza> don't hoard minutes :) you can't :)

[2020-05-03T18:28:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> ok i got the question insaanimanav :)
[2020-05-03T18:28:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> and the answer is to be polite. 
[2020-05-03T18:28:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> and to practice a lot
[2020-05-03T18:28:59+0530] <insaanimanav> oh sure
[2020-05-03T18:29:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> and to not be affected when people say stuff
[2020-05-03T18:29:18+0530] <insaanimanav> !
[2020-05-03T18:29:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> no one will come to help you when the chips are down
[2020-05-03T18:29:35+0530] <jasonbraganza> so you better focus on you first
[2020-05-03T18:29:43+0530] <jasonbraganza> like they say on the airplane
[2020-05-03T18:29:52+0530] <jasonbraganza> wear your own mask first
[2020-05-03T18:29:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> before you go help others
[2020-05-03T18:30:01+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T18:30:02+0530] <batul> insaanimanav ask your question.
[2020-05-03T18:30:05+0530] <insaanimanav> thats a great metaphor
[2020-05-03T18:30:20+0530] <insaanimanav> sorry I dont have one accidently pressed the key
[2020-05-03T18:30:31+0530] <jasonbraganza> anyone else?
[2020-05-03T18:30:46+0530] <jasonbraganza> i seem to have tired every one out XD
[2020-05-03T18:30:56+0530] <jasonbraganza> lets call it a night then
[2020-05-03T18:30:57+0530] <sidntrivedi> !
[2020-05-03T18:31:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> next
[2020-05-03T18:31:01+0530] <batul> sidntrivedi ask your question.
[2020-05-03T18:31:28+0530] <sidntrivedi> jasonbraganza: How to increase reading speed ?
[2020-05-03T18:32:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> sidntrivedi, https://medium.com/the-mission/speed-reading-is-bullshit-f5acbee7f59e
[2020-05-03T18:32:44+0530] <jasonbraganza> sidntrivedi, but once you have read enough, you will see patterns in most non fiction books that will let you skip WHOLE chapters
[2020-05-03T18:32:51+0530] <jasonbraganza> ergo faster reading :P
[2020-05-03T18:33:09+0530] <sidntrivedi> jasonbraganza: Thanks :)

[2020-05-03T18:36:39+0530] <anwesha> Thank you jasonbraganza
[2020-05-03T18:36:48+0530] <jasonbraganza> i forgot your meditation question
[2020-05-03T18:37:10+0530] <jasonbraganza> ssurbhi, anwesha, i hope you found it helpful!
[2020-05-03T18:37:57+0530] <jasonbraganza> who here wants to learn the basics of meditition?
[2020-05-03T18:38:19+0530] <ssurbhi> Me!
[2020-05-03T18:38:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> https://janusworx.com/want-to-focus.html
[2020-05-03T18:38:37+0530] <jasonbraganza> ssurbhi, there ^
[2020-05-03T18:38:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> :)
[2020-05-03T18:39:11+0530] <jasonbraganza> i listen to this daily, and it helps me meditate http://www.tarabrach.com/audio/2010-07-07-Smile-Meditation-TaraBrach.mp3
[2020-05-03T18:39:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> or i just use the free packs on the calm or headspace apps
[2020-05-03T18:39:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> How long does it take to master the practice of meditation - when you don't get distracted with all the thoughts flowing in your mind? And any suggetions on doing meditation from you please!
[2020-05-03T18:40:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> it takes a week or two to get used to it.
[2020-05-03T18:40:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> suggest you read my page up top
[2020-05-03T18:40:42+0530] <jasonbraganza> and for free guided meditations look up Tara Brach on youtube
[2020-05-03T18:40:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> How should I split the time learning things related to work and things that I want to do personally? Should I spent my time during office hours only to learn things related to work?
[2020-05-03T18:41:07+0530] <ssurbhi> Thank you for sharing these jasonbraganza! :)
[2020-05-03T18:41:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> Is your office that cool, that it lets you do personal work? XD
[2020-05-03T18:41:53+0530] <jasonbraganza> office time is office time and the time to and fro
[2020-05-03T18:41:59+0530] <jasonbraganza> everything else is me time
[2020-05-03T18:42:08+0530] <jasonbraganza> and i protect me time very zealously
[2020-05-03T18:42:36+0530] <jasonbraganza> when i die, my manager is not coming to tell me every thing at home will be taken care of
[2020-05-03T18:43:05+0530] <jasonbraganza> neither are my last thoughts going to be of oh shit, that issue on the tracker is still pending!
[2020-05-03T18:43:20+0530] <jasonbraganza> you have a contract with your employer
[2020-05-03T18:43:27+0530] <jasonbraganza> time for money remember?
[2020-05-03T18:43:33+0530] <@saptaks> jasonbraganza, I actually might have that thought
[2020-05-03T18:43:39+0530] <bhavin192> If there is overlap I just make sure I spend my personal time only if required only if it's going to add something to the things I was able to learn during work time :D
[2020-05-03T18:43:49+0530] <jasonbraganza> so the employer pays you for a fixed about of time. give him only that much
[2020-05-03T18:44:00+0530] <jasonbraganza> i know you might have to work extra
[2020-05-03T18:44:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> but don't give in so easily
[2020-05-03T18:44:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> make them fight for every minute they want to get out of you
[2020-05-03T18:44:34+0530] <jasonbraganza> extra time i meant
[2020-05-03T18:45:18+0530] <jasonbraganza> saptaks, you are a heera to your company then XD they ought to give you one of those salaam-e-tope funerals
[2020-05-03T18:45:38+0530] <jasonbraganza> bhavin192, makes a nice case!
[2020-05-03T18:45:43+0530] <@saptaks> issue on the tracker doesn't necessary have to be company. :P
[2020-05-03T18:45:48+0530] <@saptaks> jasonbraganza, also, which company?
[2020-05-03T18:46:16+0530] <jasonbraganza> whichever orgs issue you are worried about, saptaks :)
[2020-05-03T18:46:55+0530] <bhavin192> I found these sessions useful too, I attended only last three but they were great! I didn't even notice that I was meditating for ~17 minutes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0C_I-k2Ph9bsj_cGBGmidR8749g4XKU
[2020-05-03T18:47:30+0530] <@saptaks> jasonbraganza, I don't care if they think that. :)
[2020-05-03T18:48:07+0530] <jasonbraganza> ssurbhi, hope you find bhavin192’s link useful too
[2020-05-03T18:48:17+0530] <zleap> if you're not careful you end up being the 'goto' person for jobs everyone else does not want to do, as you are the one that says yes
[2020-05-03T18:48:23+0530] <jasonbraganza> saptaks, think what?
[2020-05-03T18:48:29+0530] <nabarun> I used to work on my time a lot (just out of college scenario) for my previous employer, but soon I realized that it was not doing any good personally and the employer gave a shit about the efforts. So, with time I started to value my time and did things in my free time which satisfy my goals. Eventually, I saw that it was unspoken expectation at that workplace of working on personal time, so I left the company.
[2020-05-03T18:49:19+0530] <jasonbraganza> nabarun, hope today's session helps you set expectations right in the next one
[2020-05-03T18:49:35+0530] <zleap> nabarun, sounds like a good interviwe question to the panels,  is there a proper work / life balance
[2020-05-03T18:49:54+0530] <nabarun> bhavin192 's advice makes a lot of sense here. Until and unless the office work satisfies your goals in life, don't put your personal time on it.
[2020-05-03T18:49:54+0530] <zleap> panels = interview panels
[2020-05-03T18:49:58+0530] <jasonbraganza> zleap, that is a fool's errand in an indian company :)
[2020-05-03T18:50:02+0530] <nabarun> nabarun: yes yes. :)
[2020-05-03T18:50:31+0530] <nabarun> zleap: Everything you see will be very good from outside. Once you get in, you see the real picture.
[2020-05-03T18:50:44+0530] <bhavin192> nabarun, it's opposite in my current company :) They don't want anyone to work in their personal time xD
[2020-05-03T18:50:54+0530] <zleap> i agree there nabarun
[2020-05-03T18:50:56+0530] <nabarun> zleap: Bdw, the first company I started working for them from my college.
[2020-05-03T18:51:41+0530] <nabarun> bhavin192: that's good. My current employers are nice in that sense. Very disciplined work, although it's a startup.
[2020-05-03T18:52:22+0530] <jasonbraganza> time for bed
[2020-05-03T18:52:28+0530] <jasonbraganza> good night folks!
[2020-05-03T18:52:31+0530] <zleap> i think with a new start up you start as you mean to go on
[2020-05-03T18:52:36+0530] <bhavin192> nabarun, also I kept advise we got during summer training in mind and never worked after some specific time let's say 18:00. Even during my internship, that thing helped me a lot. And yes there are exceptions to this for sure.
[2020-05-03T18:52:38+0530] <zleap> jasonbraganza, good night
[2020-05-03T18:52:41+0530] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, good night!
[2020-05-03T18:52:46+0530] <sidntrivedi> Good night jasonbraganza :)
[2020-05-03T18:52:49+0530] <nabarun> jasonbraganza: night! o/
[2020-05-03T18:53:19+0530] <pradhvan> jasonbraganza: good night. Thank you again for the session. :)
[2020-05-03T18:54:30+0530] <nabarun> bhavin192: I was a work-a-holic during and right after college. xD Eventually, toned down personal time to personal work. Office time to office duties. :)
[2020-05-03T18:56:18+0530] <sidntrivedi> nabarun: How much time do you devote to personal and office work on weekdays ?
[2020-05-03T18:58:06+0530] <nabarun> sidntrivedi:  I try to stick to 8 for office work. But, some days special circumstances occur and you need to be there, although this happens very rarely.
[2020-05-03T18:58:41+0530] <nabarun> sidntrivedi: I am yet to get better at the personal work/sleep division. Trying hard on that front. :)
[2020-05-03T18:58:53+0530] <nabarun> hope that helps!
[2020-05-03T18:59:17+0530] <hellozee> docker and zfs, not a pretty good combo
[2020-05-03T19:00:11+0530] <zleap> try and relax before sleeping
[2020-05-03T19:00:26+0530] <zleap> computers / screens are apparently not good for sleep,
[2020-05-03T19:00:47+0530] <zleap> screens mostly being mobile / computer screens
[2020-05-03T19:01:08+0530] <zleap> you can watch tv or an hour and try and wind down so you are relaxed before sleep
[2020-05-03T19:02:58+0530] <hellozee> nabarun:
[2020-05-03T19:03:14+0530] <hellozee> oops
[2020-05-03T19:03:39+0530] <hellozee> sorry, wasn't intentional
[2020-05-03T19:36:07+0530] <j605> jasonbraganza: thank you for the session and goodnight :) I had to take off a bit early for lunch
[2020-05-03T21:15:13+0530] <ASHORA> peanutduck, Thank you! That works fine but I was trying to do it by adding to the iptables rules
[2020-05-03T21:44:32+0530] <peanutduck> ASHORA, for iptables I think I would do something like this iptables -D OUTPUT -d 179.60.194.35 -j DROP
[2020-05-03T21:44:53+0530] <peanutduck> I need to learn iptables
[2020-05-03T21:55:30+0530] <@saptaks> ASHORA, iptables blocking is a little difficult with websites like facebook, google, twitter,etc.
[2020-05-03T21:55:43+0530] <@saptaks> try instead with websites like kushaldas.in or saptaks.website
[2020-05-03T22:06:48+0530] <@saptaks> I don't know if this happens to everyone but I am seeing code from literally just a month ago and I feel like a stupid idiot. And I remember spending hours on finding out a way to do it over internet and everywhere. Came up with a way which I wasn't happy about. Now afternoon while eating a much simpler idea came to mind and it seems to be working
[2020-05-03T22:08:47+0530] <@saptaks> either 1 month ago me was stupid af, or I am missing something that I thought then and I don't remember now
[2020-05-03T22:11:34+0530] <nabarun> saptaks: two points:
[2020-05-03T22:11:34+0530] <nabarun> 1. Everytime I see some of the code I wrote earlier, it seems stupid to write that way. After all we try to improve our skills all along. :)
[2020-05-03T22:11:34+0530] <nabarun> 2. For me, the ideas generally strike in my dreams or just after waking up from sleep. :P
[2020-05-03T22:12:08+0530] <@saptaks> nabarun, yeah. That happens to me... But usually at least 5-6 months
[2020-05-03T22:13:47+0530] <@saptaks> nabarun, for me also ideas strike in dream or while in bathroom or while I am eating
[2020-05-03T22:13:47+0530] <@saptaks> so that's not the part I am surprised or confused about
[2020-05-03T22:13:47+0530] <@saptaks> the thing is it hasn't even been months
[2020-05-03T22:13:47+0530] <@saptaks> and I remember specifically struggling over this
[2020-05-03T22:13:47+0530] <@saptaks> Maybe I went too deep and couldn't see the easy solution
[2020-05-03T22:13:47+0530] <@saptaks> which is so unlike me
[2020-05-03T22:13:47+0530] <nabarun> saptaks: you just need a fresh mind or one which is diverted from the problem to think of simpler solutions.
[2020-05-03T22:14:06+0530] <@saptaks> true that.
[2020-05-03T22:14:06+0530] <nabarun> I think it is true for most people.
[2020-05-03T22:14:11+0530] <@saptaks> But I am also worried maybe I have been diverted from the problem a little too long
[2020-05-03T22:14:32+0530] <@saptaks> to not remember why I didn't do this way
[2020-05-03T22:14:32+0530] • saptaks: needs to test
[2020-05-03T22:14:32+0530] <@saptaks> a lot
[2020-05-03T22:16:18+0530] <nabarun> don't stress too much. :)
[2020-05-03T22:16:18+0530] <@saptaks> nabarun, I never stress. You know why? because I am always in stress
[2020-05-03T22:16:18+0530] <@saptaks> LOL
[2020-05-03T22:16:18+0530] <@saptaks> I thought it would sound cool like Hulk dialogue
[2020-05-03T22:16:18+0530] <nabarun> LOL :P
[2020-05-03T22:16:18+0530] <@saptaks> but it doesn't
[2020-05-03T23:08:10+0530] <hellozee> nabarun: just when you are trying to sleep, you start to get the answers, XD
[2020-05-03T23:20:54+0530] <ASHORA> Sorry, I was away! peanutduck , saptaks - For FB etc, I used /etc/hosts. My problem was that iptables wasn't working for other websites too. Then it did ! Thank You :)
[2020-05-03T23:21:11+0530] <@saptaks> awesome
[2020-05-03T23:22:14+0530] <ASHORA> :)
[2020-05-04T02:26:18+0530] <j605> https://matklad.github.io//2017/03/12/min-of-three.html <- pretty good read regarding performance considerations and profiling as well
[2020-05-04T02:26:40+0530] <j605> minimum of three numbers is surprisingly difficult and also seems to depend on the order for floats
[2020-05-04T02:31:50+0530] <j605> BTW the nice profiler in julia was also one of the reasons I loved it. maybe with rust having annotated perfs you could have a better idea on what to tackle if it is still performing badly compared to what you would expect from theory
[2020-05-04T09:46:38+0530] <@kushal> Good morning
[2020-05-04T09:54:45+0530] <sourabhdeshmukh> Good Morning Everyone :)
[2020-05-04T10:49:25+0530] <@kushal> Do you use salt at work? https://www.zdnet.com/article/ghost-blogging-platform-servers-hacked-and-infected-with-crypto-miner/ bad day for you.

[2020-05-04T12:15:50+0530] <@saptaks> technically, yes
[2020-05-04T12:17:04+0530] <@kushal> Okay
